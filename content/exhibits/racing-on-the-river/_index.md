As part of Wayne State University's Winter 2025 HIS 7835: Public History course, I worked with three other students to create and present an exhibit on Detroit's hydroplane racing history at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, in partnership with the Detroit Historical Society. My contribution was writing the "Clash of the Titans" and "The Decline of Powerboat Racing" panels, along with an oral history collected for the project.
